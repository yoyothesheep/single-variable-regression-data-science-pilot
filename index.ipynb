    "In this section, we saw how we can estimate the relationship between an input variable and an output.  We did so by plotting our points and then drawing a straight line right through them.  We can see any output on a line for a given input simply by looking at the y-value of the line at that point of $x$.  We then saw how to represent a line as a mathematical formula, and ultimately a function.  We can describe lines through the formula $y = mx + b $ where $m$ represents the slope of the line, and $b$ represents the value of $y$ when $x$ equals zero.  So our $b$ variable shifts the line up or down while the $m$ variable tilts the line forwards or backwards.  Then our formula tells us that given an input number of $x$ we can find an expected return value $y$.  Translating this formula into a function, we can write a function that returns an exepceted value of $y$ for a provided value of $x$."
